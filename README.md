Search API
==========

This module provides a framework for easily creating searches on any entity
known to Backdrop, using any kind of search engine. For site administrators, it is
a great alternative to other search solutions, since it already incorporates
facetting support and the ability to use the Views module for displaying search
results, filters, etc. Also, with the Apache Solr integration [1], a
high-performance search engine is available for use with the Search API.
